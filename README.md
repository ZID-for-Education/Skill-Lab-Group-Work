# Skill-Lab-Group-Work

Group Members: Zi Han Ding, Ian Whitfield, Anna Speciale

Our group decided to create a program that asks the user for the year they were born then prints what generation they are in. We included the first input where it takes a name then for the second input we asked what year the user was born. Then with the use of elseif statements, we are able to compare the input to the generation years and print the generation they are born in.
